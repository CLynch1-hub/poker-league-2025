      <h2>Season Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        The 2025 Letterkenny Poker Hunter League has officially come to a close, marking another year of dumb-ass plays, stupid rebuys, and unforgettable nights around the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a final night of Bollywood nut farts galore! Brendan attacked the table with his mighty full house, only for Captain Morgan to demolish his house like mica bricks with the poker of 2s.
      </p>

      <p>
        After months going all-in like at an all-inclusive buffet, <strong>Kevin Lee</strong> emerged as the 2025 League Champion. If only Arsenal follows his lead into May 2026.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How could the Events Manager allow such multiple illegal rebuys!</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Thanks to the Event Manager and Champions League qualifier, Martin — ROI Champion!</em>
