        <h2>Highlights of League Opening Night — 24 January 2025</h2>

        <p>Storm Éowyn wasn’t enough to put off six brave poker players. Martin abandoned his wife in search of heat and light. Unfortunately, two squad players — Brendan and Steven — have morals!</p>

        <p>As usual, Morgan arrived just in time for the first break. Delighted to see Pocket 5s four times, he held up three — but his 99 and QQ fell to the sword every time, resulting in a rebuy. Hard to beat Kevin’s 7-2 off, as usual.</p>

        <p>The River Lee was in full flow, not a rebuy in sight — until he thought he could defeat the Director. As the night drew to a close, counting his €46, he raised three times with 88, only to meet resistance as Lynch reraised. Not to be deterred, Kevin jumped at the chance to steal the show with an all-in, only to get an instant call with KK, sending his night crashing down. So shocked was I, and under pressure from Kevin’s master plays, that I collapsed to the floor in shock — doing more damage than Éowyn.</p>

        <p>Bollywood bluffs were the star of the show, but not enough to stop Barry throwing in the orange chip before he could get a nut fart out. A poker of 6s kept him in the game until he sheepishly folded to an audacious K4 river Diver raise.</p>

        <p>Who raised six times the big blind with pocket 10s and got called by 8-5 offsuit? Our events manager. Unbelievable, Jeff!</p>
